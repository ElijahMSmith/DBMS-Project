TODOS:
- Create each page and navigation bar between them
    -	Manage university/RSO profile for super admin/admin only, respectively
    -	View events
        o	Public events: everyone sees
        o	Private events: only see if you are part of that university
        o	RSO events: only see if you are member of that RSO
    -	Unapproved (public only) events: super admin only

- Simple sign-up/login dialog/modal (don't worry about security for now)
- Create some demo objects and load them from a JS file
- Some kind of social network integration (share to another platform like facebook or google)
